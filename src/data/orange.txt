Orange trees are widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical climates for the delicious sweet fruit, which is peeled or cut, to avoid the bitter rind, and eaten whole, or processed to extract orange juice, and also for the fragrant peel. In 2008, 68.5 million tons of oranges were grown worldwide, primarily in Brazil and the State of Florida in the US.
